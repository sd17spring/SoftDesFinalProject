**Team AFK Reflection and Synthesis**

**Feedback and Decisions:**

Key Feedbacks:

1) Establish a good balance between the functional goal and the learning goal. (Oliver)
2) Check out external resources : AlphaGo Implementation (Oliver), OpenAI Universe(Sung)

3) Focus on learning feature engineering (Oliver)
4) Have a clear sense of MVP (Sung), go through iterative approach

5) Keep record of things that we don&#39;t end up using in the final project. ex) Agar.Io (Oliver)

**Review Responses:**

 After going over the background, we addressed our questions to Team : Dope Team Name, Oliver and Sung and had a several responses, covering mainly the implementation of the machine learning, which was our goal of the review, as well as making sure we are all still learning and putting our own code in, as opposed to just messing with configurations. This implementation of our own code mostly came up with Oliver&#39;s discussion on our need for going into feature engineering alongside our question about the integration of the machine learning algorithm into the pygame itself.

We are leaning towards integrated machine learning into pygame based on advice that building an clear interface between machine learning and pygame will cost us extra time and it&#39;s simply easier to implement an integrated version.

Decided on MVP: Our first minimal viable product is to get a hard coded AI together with a multiplayer version of Bomberman. With this we are putting a focus on feature extraction and interfacing between an Ai, the game and another player.

We will leave the server processing and coding for later in the project since it is a less essential part that is not necessary for the MVP.

Although the work we did on Agar.io will not affect the final project, we should still keep it around as recognition of what we tried and learned. It also adds to the story of our project.

**Next Steps:**

Our action steps are to divide up work on feature extraction and hardcoded AI. The task of the feature extraction team will be to grab the board data from a multiplayer board instance and then refactor it to be centered around the player. The AI team will take in this data and create some AI that will navigate around the board and drop bombs in a semi-intelligent way.

After putting together a basic product we will then redivide our group to focus on creating different machine learning algorithms to compete with each other.

**Review Process Reflection:**

We learned a lot, had some clarifying moments, and felt our presentation went well but felt it could have been more productive had it been in a more discussion based format. This would have heavily relied on the other team having background knowledge of machine learning, beyond the short summary we could give in the time allotted.

 On the other hand, we gained useful advice on how we should appropriately scope and implement our project. We are aware that we have been messing with different configuration of machine learning and not really get our hands on coding. But with the insights we gained from the discussion, we in a good shape to move on and start tackling down details of our project. Narrowing what we are currently working on to meet a minimum product was one goal set for the coming week, rather than be spread out on topics that may not meet the focus of our project.
