**Team AFK Project Proposal**

**Big Idea:** We are going to attempt to train a computer through machine learning to play a simple game of Bomberman. By the end of this we hope to have a working code that will play through a round of Bomberman . In doing this project we will explore machine learning as well as having the computer interface with a game, both by receiving output from it (level layout, enemy location, etc) and giving input (controlling the character, mouse, keyboard). The output will be through the actual code of the game as we will be using a PyGame version of the bomberman game, allowing us to not have to worry about pulling the variables from the game&#39;s memory locations and allow us to explore additional python libraries for example with wireless communications ro changing the game in new and interesting ways. Finally we will attempt to implement wireless multiplayer.

**Learning Goals:**

- Nick: Learning effective image processing in conjunction with machine learning to provide a smooth AI controller that does not have too much lag
- Yichen: Learning to understand and apply appropriate machine learning algorithms to the problem and explore new useful python libraries.
- Ben: Learning to research and use libraries more effectively through implementation input take-in and in response simulate specific key presses. Also learning more about and how to go about implementing neural networks and machine learning in general.
- Seungin : Learning to choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the project and learn how to implement them using python libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
- Alex: Improved confidence with group and individual programming, in addition to utilizing neural networks.

**Implementation Plan** : Identify a game and goal of the machine learning. Then explore and learn libraries that will benefit us in our goal (Tensor Flow seems to be the machine learning route we want to go). We can use the cTypes and PyAutoGUI libraries to simulate key presses. Since the game and our code will both be running in python, we should be able to easily pull game variables and use it for our machine learning.

**Project Schedule:**

End of week 1: Identify libraries and games to use

End of week 2: Understand libraries, have components working independent of one another

End of week 3: Basic integrated implementation of simulated key press, reading levels, progress in levels, have working multiplayer

   Begin website and presentation work

End of week 4: Complete project website and presentation

End of week 5: Poster created and printed, working machine learning

Part way through week 6: Clean up code, work out final presentation details

**Collaboration Plan:**

Our preliminary plan is that Nick and Seugin will work on Image Processing, Alex and Yichen will work on Machine Learning, and Ben will work on the Input. These three sections interlope and are subject to change and expand focus as our development goes on.

**Risks:**

Potentially overscoping, may need to change game

(Originally we started with Agario)

Issues with controlling and pushing data to the server

(Originally tried to use emulators, switched to pygame version of Bomberman)

Neural Networks take time

Lag time between multiplayer
