# Additional information about the project

## Next Steps
Moving forward with the project we would like for the bot to recognize powerups and search them out. Right now the Bot will not recognize powerups.

Also, the bot can often get caught in a loop, going back and forth between two squares. From there, random chance is required to get it out of that situation. In the future, code could be implemented to skew the probability of movement if the bot is caught in a loop.

Additionally we would also like for it to have a stronger directive to clear levels as opposed to just surviving. Because it is based on human player data that was specifically skewed to destroying all bricks, the bot more closely mimics this playstyle. We chose this as the training data because it was easier on and more reliable for humans to attempt.
